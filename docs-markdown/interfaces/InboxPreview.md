Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you.

To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID.

### expiresAt

• `Optional` **expiresAt**: `string`

This is the default behavior unless expiration date is set. If an expiration date is set and the time is reached MailSlurp will expire the inbox and move it to an expired inbox entity. You can still access the emails belonging to it but it can no longer send or receive email.
