### count

• `Optional` **count**: number

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3504](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3504)*

Number of results that should match conditions. Either exactly or at least this amount based on the `countType`. If count condition is not met and the timeout has not been reached the `waitFor` method will retry the operation.

### countType

• `Optional` **countType**: [CountTypeEnum](../enums/waitforconditions.counttypeenum.md)

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3510](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3510)*

### inboxId

• `Optional` **inboxId**: string

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3516](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3516)*

### matches

• `Optional` **matches**: Array\<[MatchOption](matchoption.md)>

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3522](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3522)*

Conditions that should be matched for an email to qualify for results. Each condition will be applied in order to each email within an inbox to filter a result list of matching emails you are waiting for.

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

___

### sortDirection

• `Optional` **sortDirection**: [SortDirectionEnum](../enums/waitforconditions.sortdirectionenum.md)

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3528](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3528)*

Direction to sort matching emails by created time

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

### timeout

• `Optional` **timeout**: number

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3534](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3534)*

Max time in milliseconds to retry the `waitFor` operation until conditions are met.

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

___

### unreadOnly

• `Optional` **unreadOnly**: boolean

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:3540](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/c889afa/src/generated/api.ts#L3540)*

Apply conditions only to **unread** emails. All emails begin with `read=false`. An email is marked `read=true` when an `EmailDto` representation of it has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called `getEmail` or `waitForLatestEmail` etc., or you have viewed the email in the dashboard.
