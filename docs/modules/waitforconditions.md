### count

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:4278](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/fb74c9f/src/generated/api.ts#L4278)*

Number of results that should match conditions. Either exactly or at least this amount based on the `countType`. If count condition is not met and the timeout has not been reached the `waitFor` method will retry the operation.

### countType

• `Optional` **countType**: [CountTypeEnum](../enums/waitforconditions.counttypeenum.md)

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:4290](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/fb74c9f/src/generated/api.ts#L4290)*

### matches

• `Optional` **matches**: Array\<[MatchOption](matchoption.md)>

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:4296](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/fb74c9f/src/generated/api.ts#L4296)*

Conditions that should be matched for an email to qualify for results. Each condition will be applied in order to each email within an inbox to filter a result list of matching emails you are waiting for.

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

___

### sortDirection

• `Optional` **sortDirection**: [SortDirectionEnum](../enums/waitforconditions.sortdirectionenum.md)

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:4302](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/fb74c9f/src/generated/api.ts#L4302)*

Direction to sort matching emails by created time

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

### timeout

• `Optional` **timeout**: number

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:4308](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/fb74c9f/src/generated/api.ts#L4308)*

Max time in milliseconds to retry the `waitFor` operation until conditions are met.

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

___

### unreadOnly

• `Optional` **unreadOnly**: boolean

*Defined in [src/generated/api.ts:4314](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client/blob/fb74c9f/src/generated/api.ts#L4314)*

Apply conditions only to **unread** emails. All emails begin with `read=false`. An email is marked `read=true` when an `EmailDto` representation of it has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called `getEmail` or `waitForLatestEmail` etc., or you have viewed the email in the dashboard.
