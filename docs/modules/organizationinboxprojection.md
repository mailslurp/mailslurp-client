Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you.

To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID.

Type of inbox - either HTTP (default) or SMTP. HTTP inboxes are great for testing. SMTP inboxes are processed by a custom SMTP mail server and are better for public facing inboxes that receive emails from Gmail and other large providers. If using a custom domain the domain type must match the inbox type. Use an SMTP domain for SMTP inboxes that includes an MX record pointing to `10 mx.mailslurp.com` for inbound messages.
