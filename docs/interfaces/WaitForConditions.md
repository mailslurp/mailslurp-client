# Interface: WaitForConditions

Conditions that a `waitForXEmails` endpoint operates on. The methods wait until given conditions are met or a timeout is reached. If the conditions are met without needing to wait the results will be returned immediately. Can include `unreadOnly` to ignore already read emails that were returned in an API call or viewing in the dashboard. Can also include matches for emails containing `from`, `subject`, `hasAttachments` etc.

___

### countType

• `Optional` **countType**: [`WaitForConditionsCountTypeEnum`](../enums/WaitForConditionsCountTypeEnum.md)

### inboxId

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

___

### matches

• `Optional` **matches**: [`MatchOption`](MatchOption.md)[]

Conditions that should be matched for an email to qualify for results. Each condition will be applied in order to each email within an inbox to filter a result list of matching emails you are waiting for.

### since

• `Optional` **since**: `Date`

ISO Date Time earliest time of email to consider. Filter for matching emails that were received after this date

**`memberof`** WaitForConditions

### sortDirection

• `Optional` **sortDirection**: [`WaitForConditionsSortDirectionEnum`](../enums/WaitForConditionsSortDirectionEnum.md)

### unreadOnly

• `Optional` **unreadOnly**: `boolean`

Apply conditions only to **unread** emails. All emails begin with `read=false`. An email is marked `read=true` when an `EmailDto` representation of it has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called `getEmail` or `waitForLatestEmail` etc., or you have viewed the email in the dashboard.
