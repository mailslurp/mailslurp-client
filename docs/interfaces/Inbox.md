[MailSlurp JS](../README.md) / Inbox

# Interface: Inbox

Representation of a MailSlurp inbox. An inbox has an ID and a real email address. Emails can be sent to or from this email address. Inboxes are either `SMTP` or `HTTP` mailboxes. The default, `HTTP` inboxes, use AWS SES to process emails and are best suited as test email accounts. `SMTP` inboxes use a custom mail server at `mx.mailslurp.com` and are best used for public facing email addresses. Use the `EmailController` or the `InboxController` methods to send and receive emails and attachments. Inboxes may have a description, name, and tags for display purposes. You can also favourite an inbox for easier searching. Inboxes can be private or allow team access. Team access enabled inboxes can be seen by other members of an organization.

### emailAddress

• `Optional` **emailAddress**: `string`

The inbox's email address. Inbox projections and previews may not include the email address. To view the email address fetch the inbox entity directly. Send an email to this address and the inbox will receive and store it for you.

To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID.

### expiresAt

• `Optional` **expiresAt**: `string`

Inbox expiration time. When, if ever, the inbox should expire and be deleted. If null then this inbox is permanent and the emails in it won't be deleted. This is the default behavior unless expiration date is set. If an expiration date is set and the time is reached MailSlurp will expire the inbox and move it to an expired inbox entity. You can still access the emails belonging to it but it can no longer send or receive email.

### inboxType

• `Optional` **inboxType**: [`InboxTypeEnum`](../enums/Inbox.InboxTypeEnum.md)

Type of inbox - either HTTP (default) or SMTP. HTTP inboxes are great for testing. SMTP inboxes are processed by a custom SMTP mail server and are better for public facing inboxes that receive emails from Gmail and other large providers. If using a custom domain the domain type must match the inbox type. Use an SMTP domain for SMTP inboxes that includes an MX record pointing to `10 mx.mailslurp.com` for inbound messages.
