If you need to send many emails try using contacts or contact groups or use a non standard sendStrategy to ensure that spam filters are not triggered (many recipients in one email can affect your spam rating). Be cautious when sending emails that your recipients exist. High bounce rates (meaning a high percentage of emails cannot be delivered because an address does not exist) can result in account freezing.

If no sender is set the source inbox address will be used for this field. If you set `useInboxName` to `true` the from field will include the inbox name as a display name: `inbox_name <inbox@address.com>`. For this to work use the name field when creating an inbox. Beware of potential spam penalties when setting the from field to an address not used by the inbox. Your emails may get blocked by services if you impersonate another address. To use a custom email addresses use a custom domain. You can create domains with the DomainController. The domain must be verified in the dashboard before it can be used.
