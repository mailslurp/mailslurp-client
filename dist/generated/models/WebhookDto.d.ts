 * Representation of a webhook for an inbox. The URL specified will be using by MailSlurp whenever an email is received by the attached inbox. A webhook entity should have a URL that points to your server. Your server should accept HTTP/S POST requests and return a success 200. MailSlurp will retry your webhooks if they fail. See https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-payload for the payload schema.
